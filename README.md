Group project for 2021-2022 class 12 antares
Tourism is one of the most lucrative industries in india. but a large amount of the fiscal percentage is going to the large multinational companies with chains stretching across the globe. one of the main reasons why this is happening is because of the convienence of booking a hotel from a companies website. smaller businesses with perhaps a lesser tech focused agenda may not follow suit and hence will be left behind. therefore we aim to solve this problem by putting the small businesses on the forefront of our website. this way no hotel goes unnoticied due to not having a marketing budget and all small businesses thrive thus creating jobs and stimulating the economy. i believe that in these times of monopolizing corporate interests its more important than ever to support the smaller businesses that cant invest in themselves. this will also help the consumer at large as they will be offered more choice forcing competetion and overall improving the market. thus we intend to support the community and give unbiased help to all small hotels
we intend to make it easier to get information from customers to the hotels and even help them organize their data and bookings in online database which of course comes with its many benefits over physical databases. by taking booking data from customers and delivering it to the hotel in question and storing their data to further help with future bookings.
